As a self-taught programming student, I am excited to embark on my career as a software developer. With two years of study in this field, I have developed a solid foundation in different programming languages and am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects.

I have worked on a few projects with my fellow students using the agile SCRUM methodology, I am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn, I am especially interested in improving my skills through online education platforms and as I embark on my career, I am excited to connect with other industry professionals and explore possible growth and development opportunities.
